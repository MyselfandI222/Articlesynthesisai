SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
1. IDENTIFY COMMON GROUND: What facts, findings, or viewpoints do multiple sources agree on?
2. HIGHLIGHT DIFFERENCES: Where do sources disagree, offer different perspectives, or present conflicting information?
3. ANALYZE CONTRADICTIONS: When sources conflict, present both sides fairly and note the disagreement
4. SYNTHESIZE INSIGHTS: Draw connections between different sources' approaches to the same topic
5. PROVIDE BALANCED PERSPECTIVE: Don't favor one source over another - integrate all viewpoints
6. WRITE DETAILED IDEAS: Include specific concepts, findings, data points, and arguments from the sources - don't just summarize, elaborate on the ideas

Key Themes Identified: ${topicAnalysis.keyThemes.join(', ')}
Different Perspectives: ${topicAnalysis.perspectives.join(', ')}
Conflicting Points: ${topicAnalysis.conflictingPoints.join(', ')}

ðŸš« CRITICAL - TITLE RULES (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT):
- FORBIDDEN: Do NOT mention "${topic}" ANYWHERE in the article body text
- FORBIDDEN: Do NOT use "this article", "in this piece", "this story", "the article", "here we"

CONTENT GUIDELINES:
- Write out DETAILED ideas and specific concepts from the sources - don't just mention them briefly
- Include specific findings, data points, examples, and arguments presented in the sources
- Elaborate on key concepts rather than just listing them
- Use phrases like "according to research", "studies show", "experts indicate", "some reports suggest", "other findings indicate"
- When sources disagree, use phrases like "while some research indicates..., other studies suggest..."
- Create a narrative that weaves together different perspectives on the same topic

- CREATE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, not separate paragraphs for each source
- Highlight agreements, disagreements, and different approaches to the same topic
- Maintain factual accuracy while presenting multiple viewpoints
